I will only cover the one that's needed by developers or programmers,
if the stuffs can be done through the clientpanel, i don't think
there's a need for developers to understand all features/API.

==Risks==
Please do take a good care of your own sealed credentials.
The sealed credentials could be leaked on server side(10-30%) or 
client side(70-90%), the sealed credentials are a necessity
for CRUD to function in the DB API. 

If they do get leaked in either side, it's more dangerous
in client side. 

If the sealed credentials leaked in client side, there're
2 concerns that can arise:

1. (Not Data Confidential risks concern) The sealed credentials
are more or less like an API key that developer used to let
the server momentarily know who the user really are and perform
CRUD operations. Due to it's sealed credentials, leaking it in
client side won't expose the client's actual db credentials.
Sealed refers to only server able to decrypt the credentials.

Counter:
I. To counter such issue, the sealed credentials can be
deleted by client through the panel. It's also advised that
developer change their db account password(Strong one please).

2. (Not Data Confidential risks concern) If let's say, the
sealed credentials leaked on both client and server side,
the malicious people can gain access to your database
credentials. The malicious people can then perform
CRUD operations based on your leaked and exposed credentials.
It could be ransom, it could be other kinds of attacks, the
server wouldn't know. However, in such case, because the
server encrypts the data in one way, helding your database
as ransom does not really worth their time, as it seems
to them, there's no purpose in holding a not unlockable
safe for ransom.

Counter:
1. To counter such issue, make sure that you do backups,
make sure you lock your database account. After you have
done these, make sure to ask for support from the service
provider(merchant). Due to the anonymity characteristic
that the database has, you will need to make sure that your
LoginED25519SK.txt file does not disappear.

Else there's no way to let the service provider to assume
that it was really you the owner.

If the sealed credentials leaked on server side, clients
simply need to delete the existing sealed credentials and
make a new sealed credentials. If you don't follow this
advice, it means that the malicious people can use
the leaked credentials DH SK to decrypt the sealed
credentials.

==Cryptography Keys Risk==

==Keys Lost(Default)==
By default, the keys generated by the client panel is all
random. The keys that you submitted to me during making
payment or renewing payment are all publicly disclosable
(public key cryptography). Under this circumstance, if
you lost your private key, there's no way for the merchant
to provide cryptography keys recovery.

You have full responsibility in keeping your keys private
and secure when the moment they exist on your device/
machine.
======================

==Keys Lost/Risks(Custom)==
I believe there're forks out there that can really
increases my client panel's ease of use. What you should
be concern about is the cryptography function/feature
within the other custom forks. I believe there're many
other ways of generating keys rather than relying on
password/passphrase or randomnness. 

If the cryptography function/feature within the other
custom forks use passphrases as public key cryptography's
key source. It's probably okay as u are not that likely
will lose your passphrases(presumably). However, if the
custom forks use password as public key cryptography's
key source. It's probably okay if the passwords are
randomly generated and seems like a nonsense to you.
If it's not randomly generated and it's not passphrase,
the final result of your public key cryptography's key
source is likely won't have enough length or
randomness. Hence, you will indirectly make the server
uses the weak public key to encrypt data on your behalf.

Under all circumstances, you just can't ask me to
provide keys recovery as this is not a system designed
with that principle in mind. Do keep in mind that the
key recovery is not supported(for now), if there's
people that can propose the solution. I might take
it and consider without compromising the
concept of "Post-Compromise Security".
