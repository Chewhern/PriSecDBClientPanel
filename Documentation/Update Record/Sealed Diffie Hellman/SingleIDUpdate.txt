Inserting single PK or FK db record are one of the common db CRUD
operations.

This document will assume you have already know how to read text from
directory/folder, how to use "POST" in WebAPI,
convert data into JSON string,
convert data into Base64 encoded string.

API url: 
1. https://mrchewitsoftware.com.my:5002/api/NormalSealedDHDBUpdate/ ("POST")

Prerequisites:
1. You must either purchase a db/renew a db
2. You must establish a sealed session with the server(can done through PriSecDBClientPanel)
3. Your "Application_Data/SealedCredentials" folder must exist

Steps:
1. You will need to read the name without path from "Application_Data/SealedCredentials/" folder's subfolder.
2. You will need to access the files located inside "Application_Data/SealedCredentials/" folder's subfolder that contains "B64".
3. You will need to read all the base64 encoded string reside within each of files that fulfills the criteria.
4. You will need to access a file named "PaymentID.txt" and read all the ASCII text located within "Application_Data/DBCredentials/" folder.
5. You will need to make sure the SQL Query String is a query string that has been set for preventing SQL Injection and web api server approved.
    Explanation:
      ====SQL Injection prevention query String explanation and example====
      In normal circumstances, we will do something like INSERT INTO `User`(`Email`,`Phone_Number`,`Password`) VALUES(@Email,@Phone_Number,@Password)
      This kind of SQL query is a kind of SQL prevention query string.
      =====================================================================

      ====Reserved words and limitations put deliberately==================
      The @ symbol is a reserve symbol used to create a custom parameter
      name.
      Any attempts to supply custom primary key value or custom foreign key
      value was blocked. 
      The foreign key value can only be source from primary key value.
      Developers has been banned to use ' character in SQL INSERT or
      UPDATE query.
      =====================================================================

      ==Foreign Key Table==
      The SQL Injection prevention query for update is UPDATE `User` SET `Email`=@Email,`Phone_Number`=@Phone_Number,`Password`=@Password WHERE
      `ID`=@Update_ID
      Any other parameter name that is not "Update_ID" will all get encrypted and updated in your own database.
      ====================
      
      The query string must not contain ";" character in it and it must be converted into base64 encoded string.

6. Custom parameter name like @Email,@Phone_Number,@Password is required by the system, however, due to the system reserve the @ symbol, developer
   only need to supply the custom parameter name without the @ symbol. For example, you will only need to supply the paramter names like 
   "Email,Phone_Number,Password" instead of "@Email,@Phone_Number,@Password". You will still need to supply proper SQL query that prevents
   SQL injection. You will need to look at UPDATE `User` SET `Email`=@Email,`Phone_Number`=@Phone_Number,`Password`=@Password WHERE
   `ID`=@Update_ID query string on the part that has @ symbol. By not touching the original query, you will need to split each of the custom
   parameter names into String Array elements without "@" symbol. At the end it should look something like example below:
   
   Index 0 of String Array: "Email"
   Index 1 of String Array: "Phone_Number"
   Index 2 of String Array: "Password"

   After you split the custom parameter names into String Array elements without the "@" symbol correctly, you will then require to convert each
   of the String Array element into Base64 encoded String. The Base64 encoded String element within the String Array will then be required to
   transfer all of it into a String Array that accepts only Base64 encoded String.
   
   You don't need to include reserve parameter names like "Update_ID" into the array.

7. Custom parameter value will then be required to first store in String Array that has been processed in a similar manner to step 6. The String Array
   will then be required to convert each of the element into Base64 encoded String like step 6. The converted String Array elements will then be
   required to transfer it into String Array that accepts only Base64 encoded String.

8. You will need to provide any of the primary key to update the record in database.

9. You will need to specify to the web API whether you want to use XSalsa20Poly1305 as the symmetric encryption algorithm or XChaCha20Poly1305
    as the symmetric encryption algorithm.

10. Now you need to put 10 values into 10 different variables by following the order below.
    Explanation:
      A. SealedSessionID = The subfolder name without path that retrieved from step 1.
      B. SealedDBName = The SealedDBName that retrieved from step 2 to 3.
      C. SealedDBUserName = The SealedDBUserName that retrieved from step 2 to 3.
      D. SealedDBUserPassword = The SealedDBUserPassword that retrieved from step 2 to 3.
      E. UniquePaymentID = The payment ID that retrieved from step 4.
      F. Base64QueryString = The SQL query string that generated and retrieved from step 5
      G. Base64ParameterName = The SQL custom parameter name Base64 encoded String Array that generated and retrieved from step 6.
      H. Base64ParameterValue = The SQL custom parameter value Base64 encoded String Array that generated and retrieved from step 7.
      I. IDUsedToUpdate = The SQL table's primary key value that can be used as foreign key that retrieved from step 8.
      J. IsXSalsa20Poly1305 = The Boolean value that retrieved from step 10.
11. You will need to convert them into JSON Data/String and the final result should look similar to the example below.
    {
      SealedDBCredentialModel:
      {
        "SealedSessionID":"{ASCII String}",
        "SealedDBUserName":"{Base64 Encoded String}",
        "UniquePaymentID":"{ASCII String}",
        "SignedRandomChallenge":"{Base64 Encoded String}"
      },
      "UniquePaymentID":"{ASCII String}",
      "Base64QueryString":"{Base64 Encoded String}",
      "Base64ParameterName":["{Base64 Encoded String}","{Base64 Encoded String}"],
      "Base64ParameterValue":["{Base64 Encoded String}","{Base64 Encoded String}"],
      "IDUsedToUpdate":"{ASCII String}",
      "IsXSalsa20Poly1305":"{Boolean}"
    }
12. You will need to post the converted JSON Data/String at 1st API URL.
13. The response you received will be "String_Value", if the String_Value has anything wrong it should have contain a message with "Error" characters, else it should
    have a success message.

It's better based on this document, you go to try and use the panel. The panel should give you a better Sample JSON Data/String that I put as an example in step 12.
